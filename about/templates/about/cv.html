           October 2014 - Present</p>

            <p>I was brought in by Fabric to work on a large project for Heineken entitled "Cider Tales". Initially my role required me to provide technical expertise for what was a very complex project to ensure that the production phase ran as smoothly as possible. This meant working closely with the team and a number of external suppliers of assets. I built the entire main section of the website, and assisted 2 other team members building other sections of the site. </p>

I developed both the front-end and back-end sections of the site. The site it live here:
